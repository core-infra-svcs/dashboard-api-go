        of up to 10 capture files in the cloud. When this limit is reached and a new
        capture is taken, the oldest capture will be automatically deleted to ensure
        sufficient space. Additional storage for switches will be available with an
        advantage license at a future date. These future capabilities will be consistent
        with what is available today via advantage licensing for access points.
