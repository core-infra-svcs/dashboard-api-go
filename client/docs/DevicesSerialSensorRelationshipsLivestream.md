## Methods

### NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream

`func NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream() *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream`

NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream instantiates a new DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamWithDefaults

`func NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamWithDefaults() *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream`

NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamWithDefaults instantiates a new DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetRelatedDevices

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream) GetRelatedDevices() []DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamRelatedDevices`

GetRelatedDevices returns the RelatedDevices field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetRelatedDevicesOk

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream) GetRelatedDevicesOk() (*[]DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamRelatedDevices, bool)`

GetRelatedDevicesOk returns a tuple with the RelatedDevices field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetRelatedDevices

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream) SetRelatedDevices(v []DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestreamRelatedDevices)`

SetRelatedDevices sets RelatedDevices field to given value.

### HasRelatedDevices

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream) HasRelatedDevices() bool`

HasRelatedDevices returns a boolean if a field has been set.
