## Methods

### NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices

`func NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices(serial string, ) *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices`

NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices instantiates a new DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevicesWithDefaults

`func NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevicesWithDefaults() *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices`

NewDevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevicesWithDefaults instantiates a new DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetSerial

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices) GetSerial() string`

GetSerial returns the Serial field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetSerialOk

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices) GetSerialOk() (*string, bool)`

GetSerialOk returns a tuple with the Serial field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetSerial

`func (o *DevicesSerialSensorRelationshipsLivestream1RelatedDevices) SetSerial(v string)`
