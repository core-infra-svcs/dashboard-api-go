## Methods

### NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless

`func NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless() *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless`

NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless instantiates a new NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessWithDefaults

`func NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessWithDefaults() *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless`

NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessWithDefaults instantiates a new NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless object
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set

### GetNextUpgrade

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) GetNextUpgrade() NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessNextUpgrade`

GetNextUpgrade returns the NextUpgrade field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetNextUpgradeOk

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) GetNextUpgradeOk() (*NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessNextUpgrade, bool)`

GetNextUpgradeOk returns a tuple with the NextUpgrade field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetNextUpgrade

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) SetNextUpgrade(v NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWirelessNextUpgrade)`

SetNextUpgrade sets NextUpgrade field to given value.

### HasNextUpgrade

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) HasNextUpgrade() bool`

HasNextUpgrade returns a boolean if a field has been set.

### GetParticipateInNextBetaRelease

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) GetParticipateInNextBetaRelease() bool`

GetParticipateInNextBetaRelease returns the ParticipateInNextBetaRelease field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### GetParticipateInNextBetaReleaseOk

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) GetParticipateInNextBetaReleaseOk() (*bool, bool)`

GetParticipateInNextBetaReleaseOk returns a tuple with the ParticipateInNextBetaRelease field if it's non-nil, zero value otherwise
and a boolean to check if the value has been set.

### SetParticipateInNextBetaRelease

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) SetParticipateInNextBetaRelease(v bool)`

SetParticipateInNextBetaRelease sets ParticipateInNextBetaRelease field to given value.

### HasParticipateInNextBetaRelease

`func (o *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWireless) HasParticipateInNextBetaRelease() bool`

HasParticipateInNextBetaRelease returns a boolean if a field has been set.
