## Methods

### NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts

`func NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts() *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts`

NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts instantiates a new NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts object
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed

### NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWithDefaults

`func NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWithDefaults() *NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts`

NewNetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProductsWithDefaults instantiates a new NetworksNetworkIdFirmwareUpgradesProducts object
